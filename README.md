# PetPal 

PetPal is a "match-making" app for dogs where pet owners can find other pet owners.
The goal is to broaden the network for pet owners and help them find friends for their pets.

The user can create an account and thereafter view other users and their pets.
The user can message and like other users to match with them and socialice with them.

# Installation

To run the frontend just open PetPal-Client with Visual Studio Code and run "npm install" in the terminal.

To run the backend simply open the PetPal.sln with (preferably) Visual Studio and press f5. 
SSMS must be installed in order for the backend to work. Starting the project will automatically create a Database and seed it with test data.

Run the backend together with the frontend to use the project. Frontend can be run without the backend but you'll encounter multiple errors. Simply run the backend together with the frontedn to avoid this.
